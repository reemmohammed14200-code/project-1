| East Highway | Riyadh | Dammam | 450 km | 4-5 hours |
| West Highway | Riyadh | Jeddah | 950 km | 9-10 hours |

## Security Features

### Face Verification
- Uses face-api.js for facial landmark detection
- Compares stored photos with live camera feed
- Configurable similarity threshold (currently 60%)
- Secure local processing (no external API calls)

### Data Privacy
- All data stored locally in browser
- No external server communication
- Camera access only when needed
- Automatic data cleanup on logout

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 12+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+

## File Structure

```
truck-driver-permit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # Styling and responsive design

## API Dependencies

### External Libraries (CDN)
- **face-api.js**: Face detection and recognition
- **Leaflet.js**: Interactive mapping
- **OpenStreetMap**: Map tiles and data

## Development Notes

### Face Detection Implementation
The application uses a simplified face similarity algorithm:
- Detects 68 facial landmarks
- Calculates Euclidean distance between corresponding points
- Converts distance to similarity score (0-1)
- Uses 0.6 threshold for verification

### Local Storage Schema
```javascript
// Driver data
truckDrivers: {
  [nationalId]: {
    name: string,
    nationalId: string,
    truckNumber: string,
    cargoType: string,
    photo: string (base64)
  }
}

// Permit requests
permits: [
  {
    id: string,
    date: string,
    timeSlot: string,
    route: string,
    purpose: string,
    status: 'pending'|'approved'|'rejected',
    driverId: string,
    driverName: string,
    timestamp: string
  }
]
```

## Customization

### Adding New Routes
1. Update route data in `addRouteToMap()` function
2. Add route options to HTML select element
3. Update helper functions (`getRouteName`, `getRouteDistance`, `getRouteDuration`)

### Modifying Face Verification
1. Adjust similarity threshold in `verifyFace()` function
2. Implement more sophisticated comparison algorithms
3. Add additional security measures as needed

### Styling Changes
- Modify CSS variables for color scheme
- Update animations and transitions
- Adjust responsive breakpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
- Ensure HTTPS connection
- Check browser permissions
- Try refreshing the page
- Verify camera is not in use by other applications

### Face Detection Problems
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Position face clearly in camera view
- Check if face-api.js models loaded successfully
- Try capturing photo again

### Map Display Issues
- Check internet connection for map tiles
- Verify Leaflet.js loaded correctly
- Ensure location services are enabled
