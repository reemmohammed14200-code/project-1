## üìù How It Works

### Face Verification
- Detects 68 facial landmarks
- Measures similarity via Euclidean distance
- Accepts match if similarity > 60%
- All verification is performed **locally**

### Permit Data Structure

```js
truckDrivers = {
  "1234567890": {
    name: "Ahmed",
    nationalId: "1234567890",
    truckNumber: "TRK-001",
    cargoType: "Food",
    photo: "base64string"
  }
}

permits = [
  {
    id: "P001",
    date: "2025-08-03",
    timeSlot: "10:00 AM",
    route: "Abha ‚Üí Riyadh",
    purpose: "Delivery",
    driverId: "1234567890",
    status: "approved"
  }
]
```
